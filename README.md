# Resume
Designing ATS friendly resume using Latex code with Overleaf compiler
The main.tex file contains the the latex code which is an markup code for building the resume
With this code one can use an online latex compiler to generate the document
I used overleaf for compiling the code, and generated the latex code using chatgtp
Once complied in the overleaf you can download the pdf version
