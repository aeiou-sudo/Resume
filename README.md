# Designing an ATS-friendly Resume using LaTeX

This project contains a LaTeX file (`main.tex`) that helps you design an ATS-friendly resume. LaTeX is a markup language used for creating professional documents. You can use an online LaTeX compiler like **Overleaf** to compile this code and generate your resume. The resume generated with this LaTeX code is formatted for better compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

## Steps to Follow

To compile the LaTeX code and generate the PDF version of the resume, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ats-friendly-resume-latex.git
   
2. Create a free Overleaf account if you don’t have one:
    Visit Overleaf and sign up.
3. Upload the LaTeX file (main.tex) to Overleaf:
    Once logged in, create a new project in Overleaf.
    Choose the "Upload Project" option and upload the main.tex file from this repository.
4. Compile the LaTeX code:
    Overleaf will automatically compile the LaTeX code once uploaded.
    If the compilation doesn’t start automatically, click the "Recompile" button.
5. Download the PDF:
    After the LaTeX code is compiled, you can download the generated resume as a PDF by clicking the "Download PDF" button.
